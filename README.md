## 🛠️ Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites

1. Install **Python 3.8+** and **pip**, do not use any version higher than **Python 3.11**.
2. Install **Docker** for containerized workflows.
3. Install Apache Airflow:
   ```bash
   pip install apache-airflow
   ```

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/fasihrem/mlops-project.git
   cd mlops-project
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Build Docker containers (if needed):
   ```bash
   docker-compose up --build
   ```

## 🚀 Usage

### Run Workflows
1. Start the Airflow server:
   ```bash
   airflow webserver
   airflow scheduler
   ```
2. Access the Airflow UI at `http://localhost:8080` to manage workflows.

### Train a Model
Run the training script:
```bash
python src/training/train_model.py
```

### Deploy a Model
Use deployment scripts to deploy your trained model:
```bash
python src/deployment/deploy_model.py
```
